# latest notes:
# how to find the resilience:
# find the prime factorization of the numerator and the prime factorization of the denominator
# if any of the prime factors of a numerator are a prime factor of the denominator, then the fraction is not resilient
# for example, 10/12.
# numerator prime factors are 5 and 2. Denominator prime factors are 2 (squared) and 3
# they share a common prime factor, 2. because of this, the fraction is not resilient.

# if we had a dictionary or list of the prime factorization of each number, 
#   we could search the list to see if each numerator shares any possible factors with the denominator

# improvement: even numbers will always be non-resilient, so don't need to be tested for

# pretty sure this fn is O(n^2) time complexity
